## Getting Google Bard API KEY
> **Warning** Do not expose the `__Secure-1PSID` 
 
Since Google Bard is being used as the AI backend, you need to fetch the **BARD_API_KEY** from Bard.
1. Visit https://bard.google.com/
2. F12 for console
3. Session: Application → Cookies → Copy the value of  `__Secure-1PSID` cookie.

Note that while I referred to `__Secure-1PSID` value as an API KEY for convenience, it is not an officially provided API KEY. 
Cookie value subject to frequent changes. Verify the value again if an error occurs. Most errors occur when an invalid cookie value is entered.

## Shifting Service Policies: Bard and Google's Dynamics 
Bard's service status and Google's API interfaces are in constant flux. *The number of replies is currently limited, but certain users,* such as those utilizing VPNs or proxy servers, have reported slightly higher message caps. Adaptability is crucial in navigating these dynamic service policies. Please note that the cookie values used in this package are not official API values.
